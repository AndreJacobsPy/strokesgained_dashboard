## Data Techniques
- Developed PostgreSQL database, extracting PGATour data using a custom webscraper
- Built Django API to make calling data from database easier and more accessible
- Used Polars to select, clean and filter data to create the visulaizations i wanted
    - I found that polars code is very clean looking and allows for better code while being much faster
- Grouping and aggregation to form visualizations
- Web app development using Streamlit, ensuring user can interact with data to gain insights on their favorite players
